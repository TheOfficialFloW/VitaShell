# VitaShell #

VitaShell is an alternative replacement of the PS Vita's LiveArea. It offers you a file manager, package installer, built-in FTP and much more.
This homebrew was an entry of the Revitalize PS Vita homebrew competition and won the first prize. HENkaku's molecularShell is also based on VitaShell.

### How to use an USB flash drive as Memory Card on a PS TV ###
- Format your USB flash drive as exFAT or FAT32.
- Launch VitaShell and press /\ in the 'home' section.
- Select 'Mount uma0:' and attach your USB flash drive. You can now copy stuff from/to your USB stick.
- Once 'uma0:' is listed under the partitions, press /\ again and choose 'Mount USB ux0:'. This will copy important apps like VitaShell, molecularShell, and other files.
- Your USB flash drive is now acting as a Memory Card.
- To sync all your apps on your USB flash drive, press /\ and choose 'Refresh livearea'. This will NOT refresh PSP games.
- If you wish to revert the patch, press /\ and select 'Umount USB ux0:'.
- Note that this patch is only temporary and you need to redo the procedure everytime you launch your PS TV.

**Dialog and context image:** If these files are not available, the colors **DIALOG_BG_COLOR** and **CONTEXT_MENU_COLOR** from **'colors.txt'** will be used instead.

The standard VitaShell theme is provided in **'VitaShellCustomization.rar'** and available in the **'release'** section.

### Multi-language ###
Put your language file at **'ux0:VitaShell/language/x.txt'**, **where the file must be UTF-8 encoded and 'x' is one of the language listed below:**

- japanese

VitaShell does automatically load the language that matches to the current system language.
If your system language is for example french, it will load from 'ux0:VitaShell/language/french.txt'.

The english language file is provided in **'VitaShellCustomization.rar'** and available in the **'release'** section.
