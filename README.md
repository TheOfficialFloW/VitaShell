# VitaShell

VitaShell is an alternative replacement of the PS Vita's LiveArea. It offers you a file manager, package installer, built-in FTP and much more.
This homebrew was an entry of the Revitalize PS Vita homebrew competition and won the first prize. HENkaku's molecularShell is also based on VitaShell.

## How to use an USB flash drive as Memory Card on a PS TV
- Format your USB flash drive as exFAT or FAT32.
- Launch VitaShell and press `深 in the `home` section.
- Select `Mount uma0:` and attach your USB flash drive. You can now copy stuff from/to your USB stick.
- Once `uma0:` is listed under the partitions, press `深 again and choose `Mount USB ux0:`. This will copy important apps like VitaShell, molecularShell, and other files.
- Your USB flash drive is now acting as a Memory Card.
- To sync all your apps on your USB flash drive, press `深 and choose `Refresh livearea`. This will NOT refresh PSP games.
- If you wish to revert the patch, press `深 and select `Umount USB ux0:`.
- Note that this patch is only temporary and you need to redo the procedure everytime you launch your PS TV.

**Theme setting:** VitaShell will load the theme that is set in `ux0:VitaShell/theme/theme.txt` (`THEME_NAME = "YOUR_THEME_NAME"`)

**General info:** You don't need to have all these files in your custom theme, if one of them is missing, the default image file will be loaded instead.

**Dialog and context image:** If these files are not available, the colors `DIALOG_BG_COLOR` and `CONTEXT_MENU_COLOR` from `colors.txt` will be used instead.

## Multi-language
Put your language file at `ux0:VitaShell/language/x.txt`, where the file must be UTF-8 encoded and `x` is one of the language listed below:

- japanese
- english_us
- french
- spanish
- german
- italian
- dutch
- portuguese
- russian
- korean
- chinese_t
- chinese_s
- finnish
- swedish
- danish
- norwegian
- polish
- portuguese_br
- turkish

VitaShell does automatically load the language that matches to the current system language.
If your system language is for example french, it will load from `ux0:VitaShell/language/french.txt`.

Languages files are available in the `l10n` folder of this repository.
